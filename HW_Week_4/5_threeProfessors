When three professors are seated in a restaurant, the hostess asks them:
"Does everyone want coffee?"
The 1st professor says: "I don't know"
The 2nd professor says: "I don't know"
The 3rd professor says: "No, not everyone wants coffee"
The hostess comes back & gives coffee to the professors who want it.
How did she figure out who wanted coffee?


Answer:
1st professor doesn't know if everyone wants coffee, which implies he does want coffee
2nd professor doesn't know if everyone wants coffee, which implies he does want coffee
3rd professor's clear "NO" tells the hostess that he doesn't want coffee.

"I don't know" - indicates they want coffee, but not aren't sure about everyone else.

The hostess brings coffee to the 1st and 2nd professors.
