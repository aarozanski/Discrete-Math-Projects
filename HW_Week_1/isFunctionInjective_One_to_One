Which functions are injective (i.e., one-to-one)?

1. ƒ : ℤ ➝ ℤ defined by ƒ(n) = 3n    ⬇︎
This function is injective because each input integer 𝑛 maps to a unique output 3𝑛,
and no two different inputs share the same output.

2. 𝑔 : {1,2,3} ➝ defined by 𝑔 = (1 ➝ c, 2 ➝ a, 3 ➝ a)  ⬇︎
This function is not injective because the outputs 'a' for inputs 2 and 3 are the same,
meaning the same output 'a' comes from two different inputs (2 and 3)

3. ℎ : {1,2,3} ➝ {1,2,3} defined as follows: (1 ➝ 2, 2 ➝ 2, 3 ➝ 3) ->
