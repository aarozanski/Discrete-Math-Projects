Solve the inequality and graph the solution set. State the answer in both set builder notation and in interval notation

10-(2y + 1) ≤ -4(3y +2) -3

The open the brackets with subtraction / adding, we need to change the - + signs.

10 -2y -1 ≤ -12y - 8 - 3
-2y + 12y ≤ -10 + 1 - 8 - 3
10y ≤ -20 --> divide by 10
y  ≤ - 2

Interval Notation: (-∞, -2]
Builder Notation : { y | y ≤ -2 }
