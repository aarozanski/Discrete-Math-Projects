Write the point-slope form of an equation of a line that passes through the points (5,1) and (8,7).

This formula is to find out the point-slope equation (tochechno-naklonnaya forma uravneniy):
y - y, = m(x - x,)      , where m - the slope (naklon pryamoy)

𝓂 =  𝓎„ - 𝓎, / 𝓍„ - 𝓍,

let (𝓍, 𝓎,) = (5, 1)
let (𝓍„ 𝓎„) = (8, 7)

𝓂 = 7-1/8-5 = 6/3 = 2
𝓂 = 2

y - 7 = 2(x - 8)   or it can be like this too:
y - 1 = 2(x - 5)

This is the point-slope form of an equation

Now let's find the slope-intercept form  ( :
