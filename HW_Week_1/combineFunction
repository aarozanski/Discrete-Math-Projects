Find and simplify the functions (g-f)(x) and (g/f)(x), given:
 f(x) = x-1
 g(x) = x^2 - 1

 Are they the same function?

1. (g-f)(x)
(x^2 - 1)-(x-1)
x^2 - 1 -x +1  ---> -1 and 1 will be cancelled
x^2 - x

2. (g/f)(x)
x^2 - 1 / x-1
(x+1)(x-1) / x-1   ---> x-1 will be cancelled
x+1

Answer : These functions are NOT the same

1. (g-f)(x) = x^2 - x
2. (g/f)(x) = x+1
