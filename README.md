# Discrete Math Repository

## Overview

This section of the repository contains Java-based projects and exercises related to Discrete Mathematics. It includes implementations and solutions for key topics such as:

- Set Theory
- Logic and Propositional Calculus
- Combinatorics
- Graph Theory
- Functions and Relations
- Number Theory

The purpose of this repository is to help students and developers understand and practice Discrete Mathematics concepts through practical Java implementations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific Discrete Math topic:

- `set_theory/`: Java implementations demonstrating set operations like unions, intersections, and Cartesian products.
- `logic/`: Code for evaluating logical propositions, truth tables, and Boolean algebra.
- `combinatorics/`: Examples of combinatorial problems such as permutations, combinations, and the pigeonhole principle.
- `graph_theory/`: Java implementations for graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, shortest paths, and graph coloring.
- `relations/`: Examples of relations, equivalence classes, and properties like transitivity, reflexivity, and symmetry.
- `number_theory/`: Algorithms for greatest common divisor (GCD), modular arithmetic, and prime numbers.

## Prerequisites

Before running any project from this section, ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 11 or higher
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (if you're using a build tool)
- **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or any Java-compatible IDE
- **Git** for version control (optional)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   git clone https://github.com/Jizelino/discrete-math-repo.git
   cd discrete-math-repo

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE.

3. Import the project as a Maven or Gradle project if the folder contains pom.xml or build.gradle.
