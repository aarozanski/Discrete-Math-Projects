Solve x(x+3)^2(x-4)<0

I need to identify critical points, where f(x) = 0:
x < 0              x+3 < 0             x-4 < 0
x = 0              x = -3              x = 4

we can draw on the line and identify / mark these critical points

we can select numbers which are less than -3 , between -3 and 0 , between 0 and 4 , and more than 4



Answer: ( 0,4 )
The function is negative for x values in between 0 and 4
