1. If ƒ(x) is a linear function, and (3,-2) and (8,1) are the points on the line, find the slope (𝓂)

We have the formula to find 𝓂

𝓂 =  𝓎„ - 𝓎, / 𝓍„ - 𝓍,

𝓂 = 1 - (-2) / 8 - 3 = 3/5

2. Is this function increasing or decreasing?

The function is increasing since the slope (𝓂) is positive --> 3/5

As you move from left to right along the line, the value of y increases
