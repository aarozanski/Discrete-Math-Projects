Which functions are surjective (i.e., onto) ?

1. ƒ : ℤ ➝ ℤ defined by ƒ(n) = 3n
Analysis:

The function ƒ(n) = 3n maps any integer n to three times that integer.
This means the output will always be a multiple of 3 (e.g., ..., -9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, ...).
This function is not surjective because there are integers in the codomain (like 1, 2, 4, 5, etc.) that are not mapped by any integer from the domain.

2. 𝑔 : {1,2,3} ➝ defined by 𝑔 = (1 ➝ c, 2 ➝ a, 3 ➝ a)  -> This function is not surjective because 'b' is not covered by any element of the domain.

3. ℎ : {1,2,3} ➝ {1,2,3} defined as follows: (1 ➝ 2, 2 ➝ 2, 3 ➝ 3) -> This function is not surjective because '1' is not covered by any element of the domain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a function 𝑓 maps elements from set 𝐴 to set 𝐵, then the function is surjective if:

Every element in 𝐵 has at least one element in 𝐴 that maps to it.

A surjective function ensures that every element in the output set is hit by at least one element from the input set.
If there are elements in the output set that don’t get mapped, then the function is not surjective.
