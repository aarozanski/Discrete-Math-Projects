Determining if a relation is a function with mapping

Lydia     321-549-3327  home
Eugene    427-658-2314  cell
Janet     321-964-7324  cell
Rick      684-358-7961  home
Marty     684-369-7231  cell
          798-367-8541  cell

Lydia has 2 phone numbers associated with her: 321-549-3327 and 321-964-7324
This means Lydia has multiple outputs, which violates the definition of a function

Eugene and Janet mapping to the same phone number (427-658-2314) is acceptable in a function, as different inputs can share the same output.

Rick maps to a unique phone number: 798-367-8541, which does not violate the function rule.

Marty maps to 2 different phone numbers: 684-358-7961 and 684-369-7231, which also violates the function rule.

Conclusion

Since Lydia and Marty each map to more than one phone number, this relation is NOT a function.
A function requires that each input has only one unique output.
