Which functions are surjective (i.e., onto) ?

1. ƒ : ℤ ➝ ℤ defined by ƒ(n) = 3n
2. 𝑔 : {1,2,3} ➝ defined by 𝑔 = (1 ➝ c, 2 ➝ a, 3 ➝ a)
3. ℎ : {1,2,3} ➝ {1,2,3} defined as follows: (1 ➝ 2, 2 ➝ 2, 3 ➝ 3)











If a function 𝑓 maps elements from set 𝐴 to set 𝐵, then the function is surjective if:

Every element in 𝐵 has at least one element in 𝐴 that maps to it.

A surjective function ensures that every element in the output set is hit by at least one element from the input set.
If there are elements in the output set that don’t get mapped, then the function is not surjective.
