Express the arithmetic series:

S = 5 + 9 + 13 +...+ 89 in sigma notation

I will use this general term formula:

A n = a + (n-1)* d
where a = 5
      d = 4

A n = 5 + ( n-1 ) * 4
A n = 5 + 4n - 4
A n = 4n + 1

4n + 1 --> means, for any term number 𝑛, multiply 𝑛 by 4 and then add 1
to get the value of that term in the sequence

4n + 1 = 89
4n = 88
n = 22

There are 22 terms in the S sequence

Answer:

22
𝛴 (4n+1)
n=1
