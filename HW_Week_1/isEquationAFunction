Determine if each of the following equations are functions:

a. y = x^2 + 1

If we replace 𝓍 with any other number , 𝓍 will give only one answer for 𝓎
for example:
y = 2^2 + 1           or y = 3^3 + 1
y = 5                    y = 10

b. y^2 = x + 1

If we replace 𝓍 with any other number, we get two different values for 𝓎, one positive and one negative.
This violates the rule of functions. Therefore, y^2 = x + 1 is not a function, because a single value of
𝓍  gives two different values of 𝓎

for example:
y^2 = 3 + 1
y = ±√ 4
y = ± 2

2^2 = 4   and (-2)^2 = 4

NOTE: A function stats , that for each value of 𝓍, there will be only one value of 𝓎.
