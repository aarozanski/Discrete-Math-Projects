Write a formula for a transformation of the toolkit reciprocal function

f(x) = 1/x that shifts the function's graph one unit to the right and one unit up

1. Shift Right: To shift the graph to the right by one unit, I replaced x with x-1 in the function.
   Which makes the function f(x) = 1/ x-1

2.
