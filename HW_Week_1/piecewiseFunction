Evaluate the following piecewise-defined function for the given values of 𝓍 , and graph the function

ƒ(𝓍) = { -2𝓍 + 1     -1 ≤ 𝓍 < 0   - endpoints are closed
       { x^2 + 2      0 ≤ 𝓍 ≤ 2   - open circle

-2𝓍 + 1
---------------------------
𝓍 | -1 | -0.5 |  0 - cross
𝓎 |  3 |   2  |  1 - cross

𝓍^2 + 2
---------------------------
𝓍 |  0 |  1   |  2  |
𝓎 |  2 |  3   |  6  |
