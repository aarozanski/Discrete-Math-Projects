system of linear functions with x and y unknown, need to solved simultaneously
in curly braces:
2x + y = 7
x - 2y = 6

y = 7 - 2x -> moved 2x to the right side with negative sign
x - 2y = 6  -> leaving this function as it is for now

x - 2( 7 - 2x ) = 6 -> replaced 𝓎 with (7 - 2x)
x - 14 + 4x = 6
x + 4x = 6 + 14
5x = 20 -->  divide by 5
x = 4 --> the answer for x

now we have to find y :   y = 7 - 2x , by replacing x with 4
y = 7 - 2*4
y = -1 --> the answer for y
