2. Find the domain and range of the following function: h(x) = -2x^2 + 4x - 9

This is a quadratic function, which is defined for all real values of ùë• because there are no restrictions like square roots or division by zero.

x ‚àà ‚Ñù

Domain : x ‚àà ( -‚àû, ‚àû )

we have used this formula: h(x)= ax^2 + bx + c
 which is:                       a=-2   b=4  c=-9

then I used formula : x = - b / 2a

x = -4 / 2 * (-2)  = -4 / (-4) = 1

now let's put 1 instead of h(1) : -2 (1)^2 + 4 * 1 - 9 = -2 + 4 - 9 = -7

Because of negative in front of 2 ( -2) , it is indicating that function has max value and parabola opens downwards. So - 7 is the max value

Range : ( -‚àû , - 7 ]
