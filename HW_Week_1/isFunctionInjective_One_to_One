Which functions are injective (i.e., one-to-one)?

1. ƒ : ℤ ➝ ℤ defined by ƒ(n) = 3n    ⬇︎
This function is injective because each input integer 𝑛 maps to a unique output 3𝑛,
and no two different inputs share the same output.

2. 𝑔 : {1,2,3} ➝ defined by 𝑔 = (1 ➝ c, 2 ➝ a, 3 ➝ a)  ⬇︎
This function is not injective because the outputs 'a' for inputs 2 and 3 are the same,
meaning the same output 'a' comes from two different inputs (2 and 3).

3. ℎ : {1,2,3} ➝ {1,2,3} defined as follows: (1 ➝ 2, 2 ➝ 2, 3 ➝ 3)  ⬇︎
This function is not injective because the output 2 is shared by two different inputs (1 and 2),
meaning it fails the unique mapping criterion of injectivity.

An injective function ensures that no two different inputs should map to the same output.
