1. Find the domain and range of the following function: g(x) = 2√x-4

This is a square root function, which is a type of radical function.

Solution:
x-4 ≥ 0
x ≥ 4

!!! The expression inside the root cannot be negative !!!

Domain: [4 , ∞ )

Since the expression inside the root al always non negative , smallest value of √x-4 can be 0, when x = 4

g(4) = 2√4-4 = 2 * 0 = 0

as x = ∞ , g(x) = ∞

!!! The range of g(x) is all non-negative real numbers!!!

Range: [ 0, ∞ )
