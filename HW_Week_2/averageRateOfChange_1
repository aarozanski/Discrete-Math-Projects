Compute the average rate of change of f(x) = x^2 - 1/x on the interval [2,4]

first we need to plug 2 and 4 into the function separately to find the f(a) and f(b)

f(2) = 2^2 - 1/2 = 3.5
f(4) = 4^2 - 1/4 = 15.75

let's find the difference in function values:
15.75-3.5= 12.75

The interval length would be:
4-2 = 2

Compute the average rate of change:
12.25/2= 6.125

Answer: 6.125

Here is the formula :

A = f(b) - f(a) / b-a
